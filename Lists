#Notes for Sep 3rd:

# Can use range and list in for loop
for i in range(1, 10, 2):

# Lists are used with brackets [] and can be modified after assigned. Mutable.
list = ["some", "list", "separated", "by", "commmas"]
list.append("allows you to add to list")

# List comprehensions
# Combines the for loop and creation of new elements in one line.
multiples = [x for x in range(1,51) if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0]

# Create a list with the squares of numbers from 1 to a scannes number using list comprehension.
n = int(input("Enter an integer: ")
list = [i^2 for i in range(1, n+1)
print(list)

# Python List Operations
#Can add, subtract, repeat, slice, and access list elements the same way as with strings.
num = [1, 2, 3]
num.append(5)   # just gets added to the end of the list
num.insert(2, 22)   # the place, then what's being inserted

# Common List Methods
remove()   # removes the first occurence of a specified value
index()    # returns the index of the first occurence of the value
count()   # returns the number of occurences of a value
sort/ed()   # sorts the list in place (sort()) or returns a new sorted list (sorted())

# List Practice
n = int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))
elements = []
while n:
  elements.append(int(input()))
  n -= 1
print(elements)
# Check if all elements are equal. Print true, otherwise false.
if len(elements) < 2:
  print(bool(True))
else:
  print(bool(False))

# Tuple- similar to a list, but CANNOT be changed after declared
# Create a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3.5, "UP")
print(my_tuple[-1])   # can be called on but not modified
# my_tuple[0] = 5  # error

# Tuple Practice
# Unpacking
a, b, c, d = my_tuple
print(a, b, c, d)  # will print (1, 2, 3.5, "UP")

# Nested tuple
points = (
  (1, 2, 3)
  (4, 5, 6)
)
print(points)
# Use tuples for things that shouldn't change. Faster and uses less memory than lists. Can be used as keys in dictionaries and return multiple values. Immutable.

# Dictionaries
# Mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs.
my_dict = {"name": "Jack", "age": 25, "city": "Lakeland"}
my_dict2 = dict(name = "Anna", age = 19, city = "Orlando")  # built-in function
empty_dict = {}
print(my_dict)
print(my_dict2)
print(empty_dict)
print(my_dict["name"])
